"of an aortic aneurysm: a pulsating bulge or a strong pulse in the abdomen feeling of fullness after minimal food intake nausea vomiting where the aorta widens into a bulge, blood clots (thrombi) are more likely to form. if a piece of a blood clot breaks off, it travels through the circulatory system until it lodges somewhere. the clot can cut off blood flow to any area of the body. symptoms depend on which part of the body is deprived of blood. in the most serious cases, the broken off fragments can cause stroke or heart attack. the fragments can also cause one or more vital body organs, such as the lungs, liver, or kidneys, to stop functioning properly. in less serious cases, it might cause numbness, weakness, tingling, pallor, or coldness in an arm or leg, loss of sensation, light-headedness, or localized pain. any of these symptoms can also occur with dissection of the aorta. the pain in the chest or pain may be particularly severe, and may mimic a heart attack. in ruptured aneurysm or dissection, internal bleeding will occur. if you have any of these symptoms along with the other symptoms of aortic aneurysm, you could be in danger and must seek emergency medical care right away. other symptoms include the following: light-headedness confusion weakness shortness of breath rapid heart beat sweating numbness or tingling loss of consciousness (fainting) this is a medical emergency. if the bleeding is uncontrolled, your blood pressure will drop dangerously low. your organs will not receive enough blood to function normally. this is called circulatory collapse, or just ""shock."" this is a life-threatening condition. you lose consciousness if your brain does not receive enough blood. your other organs may start to fail. your heart can stop beating. this is called cardiac arrest and is often fatal. if you have any concerns about the above call 911 followup instructions: please call",0,172567

"pending service: ccu servic history of present illness: this is an 84 year old man with a history of angina and mild dementia, who was transferred from an outside hospital after an episode of hypotension after a single-car motor vehicle accident. mr. has not driven in approximately one year secondary to his increasing inattentiveness and forgetfulness, however, his wife was ill in the hospital and he wished to visit her, so despite her protestations, he was driving to see her when he swerved around a parked car and hit a telephone pole. the air bag in his car deployed. there was no loss of consciousness as noted by witnesses at the scene but he was disoriented. his only complaint at the time was of right hip and knee pain. he was taken to hospital where he was hemodynamically stable on initial evaluation except for an oxygen saturation of 88% on room air that became 96% on two liters. examination was also notable for right hip tenderness. at that time, he had no recall of the accident. he had chest, pelvis and cervical spine films that were negative. he had a head ct scan that was negative. he had abdominal and pelvic ct scan that showed a pelvic fracture. at that point, his creatinine was during his stay, he became transiently hypotensive to the 80s that responded to fluids. he was transferred then to for observation on the trauma service. early in the morning following admission, he was noted to have a progressive decline in blood pressure to the 70s systolic. he denied chest pain or shortness of breath at that time. his oxygen saturation at that point was 98% on two liters nasal cannula, nonrebreather reportedly. an ekg showed new t wave inversions in iii and avf that had not been present on transfer. a few hours later, the t wave inversions deepened and he developed an new",1,139952
